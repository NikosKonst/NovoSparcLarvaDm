## Overview

This repository contains the code used to spatially reconstruct and analyze single-cell gene expression patterns during the development of the **Drosophila optic lobe**. It integrates single-cell transcriptomics with computational spatial inference, allowing users to:

- Reconstruct spatial gene expression maps from scRNA-seq data
- Identify spatial gene modules and regionalized expression
- Visualize developing neuronal structures at cellular resolution

---

## Usage

Run the main reconstruction pipeline:

```bash
python run_cartography.py --config configs/optic_lobe.yaml
```

Or explore results interactively via Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/optic_lobe_reconstruction.ipynb
```

Example input/output data and config files are provided in the `/examples` directory.
